# Blockchain Encryption Visualization ⛓️

A web-based application that visually demonstrates the core concepts of a blockchain. Add new blocks, explore the chain, and understand how cryptographic hashing links them together in a secure and immutable ledger.



## Description

This project provides a hands-on experience with blockchain technology. It simplifies the complex world of cryptocurrency and distributed ledgers into an easy-to-use interface. Users can add data to create new blocks and see in real-time how they are added to the chain. The history page offers a visual representation of the entire blockchain, allowing users to inspect the details of each block.

## Features

* **Add New Blocks:** Easily add new data to the blockchain through a simple form.
* **Blockchain Visualization:** View the entire blockchain as a series of interconnected blocks.
* **Block Details:** Click on any block to view its details, including its hash, the previous block's hash, timestamp, and data.
* **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.
* **Secure and Immutable:** Experience the security of a blockchain where each block is cryptographically linked to the previous one.
